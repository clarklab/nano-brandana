- **Upscale**: Upscale the image and enhance details
- **Warmer**: Make the image warmer with enhanced warm tones
- **Desaturate**: Desaturate the image to make it more muted

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Netlify Functions (serverless)
- **AI**: Vercel AI Gateway â†’ Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
- **Concurrency**: Client-side queue with p-limit (3-5 parallel requests)
- **State**: Client-side only, no database

## Testing the Function

Test the image processing function directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/process-image \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "image": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...",
    "instruction": "Remove the background"
  }'
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Rate Limits**: The app implements automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Large Images**: Images are automatically resized client-side if > 2048px
- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your Vercel AI Gateway key is properly set in Netlify
