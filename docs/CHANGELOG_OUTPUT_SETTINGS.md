# Changelog: Output Settings Update

## New Features

- **Quality Picker** — Choose output resolution: SD (1K), HD (2K), or 4K. Moved from the generate button to a dedicated inline picker for easier access.

- **Aspect Ratio Picker** — Select from preset aspect ratios: Auto (AI decides), Square (1:1), Portrait (4:5), Story (9:16), Wide (16:9), and Photo (3:2).

- **Custom Size / Exact Dimensions** — Specify exact pixel dimensions (e.g., 400×600) for your output images. The system automatically selects optimal generation settings and resizes to your exact specifications. Minimum size: 256×256.

- **Improved Controls Layout** — Quality and ratio pickers now appear as compact inline controls in the chat footer, keeping the interface clean while making settings more accessible.

- **Relocated Cancel Button** — The "Cancel Job" action now appears in the Results column header near the timer for better visibility during processing.
