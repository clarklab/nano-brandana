# Netlify redirects for SPA (Single Page Application)
# This ensures all routes are handled by the React app, including auth callbacks

# API routes - let them through to Netlify Functions
/.netlify/* /.netlify/* 200

# All other routes - serve the SPA (index.html)
# This is CRITICAL for Supabase auth callbacks to work
# When a user clicks the magic link, Supabase redirects to your domain with auth tokens in the URL
# Without this rule, Netlify would return 404 instead of serving the React app
/* /index.html 200
